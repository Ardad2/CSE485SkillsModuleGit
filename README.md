# CSE 485 Skills Module Assignment

This is an application that I built to demonstrate that I've learnt the skill of "Git" for my CSE 485 course's Skills Module assignment. 
This is a basic mobile application built with React Native to practice some git.
The user can add and delete tasks that they have completed.
